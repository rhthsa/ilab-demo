In addition, the band performed and released "The Emptiness Machine", the lead single of the group's forthcoming album From Zero, which is set to be released on November 15, 2024.
The band's decision to add Armstrong was met with some criticism due to her connections with the Church of Scientology and perceived support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson.

From Zero is the upcoming eighth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, set to be released on November 15, 2024, through Warner Records and Machine Shop. It is Linkin Park's first studio album since One More Light (2017), and their first to feature new singer Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara on vocals, as well as the band's new drummer Colin Brittain. It is the band's first album without vocalist Chester Bennington following his death in 2017 as well as drummer Rob Bourdon due to his departure from the band. 

The album's title has a double meaning; it is a reference to both the band's original name, Xero, and the band's new chapter with Armstrong and Brittain
