Unbeknownst to the public, in 2023, the band approached Armstrong and Brittain to reform as Linkin Park to record and release new music and perform the band's back catalogue. 

A previously unreleased song from the One More Light sessions, "Friendly Fire", was released on February 23, 2024. 

This was followed up by the band's first greatest hits album, Papercuts, which was released on April 12. 

The collection also includes "Friendly Fire", as well as the first official release of the song "Qwerty", which first appeared on LP Underground 6.0 in 2006. 

On April 30, 2024, Billboard reported that Linkin Park's booking agency WME had taken offers for both a potential reunion tour and headlining festival dates to take place in 2025, with the lineup featuring Shinoda, Delson, Farrell, and a female vocalist in place of Bennington.

At a livestreamed event on September 5, Linkin Park announced the band's comeback, including Armstrong and Brittain's entry into the band. 

In addition, the band performed and released "The Emptiness Machine", the lead single of the group's forthcoming album From Zero, which is set to be released on November 15, 2024. 

The band's decision to add Armstrong was met with some criticism due to her connections with the Church of Scientology and perceived support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson. 

The Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who had first directed the aforementioned accusations towards Armstrong back in 2023, stated that Linkin Park was "not doing their due diligence before hiring her". 

One of Bennington's sons said that Linkin Park "betrayed the trust" of the fanbase with the change.

Armstrong responded to the criticism via an Instagram story, stating that she had not been in contact with Masterson since attending his 2020 court appearance and that she condemned his crimes. 

However, she did not clarify her status with Scientology.

Linkin Park embarked on a nine-date arena tour across four continents on September 11 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. 

After Alex Feder performed in his place at the comeback event, Delson announced his decision to withdraw from touring to concentrate on the "behind the scenes" aspects of the band.

The tour is scheduled to conclude in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, on November 16, 2024.According to Shinoda, Linkin Park will be "touring heavily" in 2025. 

The album's second single, "Heavy Is the Crown", was released on September 24, 2024, and will be used as the main theme for Riot Games' 2024 League of Legends World Championship. 

The album's third single, "Over Each Other", was released October 24, 2024
